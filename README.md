# ML Task Overview

## Data Description:
- A database of 33,500 micro and small business loans disbursed between July 2020 and March 2022 by a fictitious bank in Kenya.
- The loans can be denominated in local currency or in USD, but all values in the database are represented in USD equivalent.

## Work Completed:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the data and handled missing values. Converted the categorical variables into binary modalities for both the bonus task and the scoring model.
2. **Feature Selection**: Excluded contract-related variables such as disbursement date, loan amount, maturity, and effective annual rate. Utilized domain knowledge and correlation analysis for other features.
3. **Model Development**: Developed a logistic regression model. Segregated approximately 20% of the observations for "out-of-sample" validation.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance using both primary and validation classification tables.
5. **Recommendation**: Provided strategic insights based on the scoring model's outcomes and suggested implementation steps for the credit department.
